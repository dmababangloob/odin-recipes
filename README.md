# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipe website that showcases a collection of different recipes.

By the end of this project, I will have learned a couple of skills:


- Basic knowledge of HTML
- Structuring content with lists and headings
- Images embedded into webpages
- Using Git and GitHub for managing and version control of projects


This project is part of the [The Odin Project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/)
